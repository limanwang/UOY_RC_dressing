# Contributing to RCareWorld

## Before you contribute

### Double-check Documentation and Forums

Please read RCareWorld's [documentation](https://sunny-building-1e7.notion.site/Full-install-RCareWorld-All-you-need-to-know-c5432d938f9545299f2b268373ec8abc) and look
through current topics on our GitHub
[issues](https://github.com/empriselab/RCareWorld/issues) and
[discussions](https://github.com/empriselab/RCareWorld/discussions) pages to avoid reinventing the wheels.

## Contributing

### Reporting bugs

How to submit a good bug report:

- Use a clear and descriptive title.

- Make it easy to reproduce the problem. If this requires a model, attach it as
a zip file to the bug report. If there's a script file, also include it. The model and steps required to reproduce the
problem should be *minimal*, in the sense that irrelevant parts are
removed.

- Clearly state what is the expected behavior.

- Include an illustrative screenshot or video, if relevant.

Try to provide context:

- If the problem is new, see if you can reproduce it in an older version.
What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen?

- What is the Unity version you are using if this is a Unity related issue?

- Can you reproduce the problem on multiple platforms?

### Suggesting enhancements

Before submitting an enhancement suggestion:

- Check if you're using the latest version.

- Perform a quick search in the existing issues to
see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to
the existing one instead of opening a new one.

How to submit a good enhancement suggestion:

- Use a clear and descriptive title.

- Describe the current behavior and the behavior that you hope to see instead.

- Explain why this enhancement would be useful.

- Specify the version of RCareWorld, Unity, and the platform/OS you are using.

### Contributing code

- For major bug fixes, please get in touch with us
before you start working on a contribution so that we can help and possibly
guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid frustration later
on. Please send an email to ry273 at cornell dot edu with `rcw bugfix` in the title.

- All submissions require review. Please use GitHub pull requests for this
purpose. Please consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on pull requests.

- Adequately comment your code.

- Make small pull requests. We will likely ask you to split up a large pull
request into self-contained, smaller ones, especially if the PR is trying to
achieve multiple things.

- Respond to reviewers. Please be responsive to any questions and comments.

Once you have met all the requirements, your code will be merged.
